Dissertation:
 - needs proper structure of a technical report:
   - proper numbering of all elements
   - proper cross references within the text
   - precise definitions of all terms and forms of poker etc.
   - bibliography at the end!


Code:

Where are the Doxygen comments?
Makefile needed.

Better "*.hpp" than "*.h".


No functions toString are needed, but conversion functions.
No functions equal are needed, but the ==-operator (if needed!).

No using-directives in header-files (just remove "using namespace std;").

No tab-symbols.
